I am a student at Northeastern University studying Media and Screen Studies with minors in Theatre and Music. My primary interests are in the film industry, either behind or in front of the camera. I have been acting since I was 6 years old through a variety of acting classes at or outside of school. In Highschool, I took acting every year and participated in countless plays and films in class and after school. In college, I have continued to take classes, but have shifted my focus towards acting for the camera and filmmaking,

Video production has been my main hobby throughout my life. I made my first video when I was 9 years old using simple tools and quickly progressed to Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, including plugins from companies such as Boris FX and Red Giant. Most of my video production was gameplay videos of my friends and I playing video games like Minecraft, Fortnite, and competitive titles including Overwatch and Valorant. Since my later highschool years, I have focused more on narrative film production.
