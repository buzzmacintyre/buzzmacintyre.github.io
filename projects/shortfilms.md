# **Short films**

## _Valentine_ 
- A short film depicting an unlikely connection between two polar opposites on Valentineâ€™s night. I made this film in my intro to film production course in early 2024. I wrote, casted, produced, directed, shot, and edited this short using university mandated equipment and Adobe Creative Suite. This project heavily utilized artful location and color theory, with all post production--sound mixing, color correction, and general editing--done in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## _Shot for Shot_
- A short film depicting a stressful student-film project between a group of enemies goes awry. This was my final film in my intro to film production class which I made with in group of four people. I worked in directing, producing, shooting, and editing this film among my peers. We were far more ambitious with this project than we were on our solo productions, opting for more challenging shots (long takes, steadycam) and produced lighting.

## _The Musical_
- A satirical mockumentary-style short film depicting an oddball highschool attempting to put on a musical that takes an unexpected twist. I wrote, casted, directed, and edited this film over the course of my second semester senior year of highschool in 2023. It was an amazing experience and showcases my comedic writing strengths in an alternative style to my other works.

## _"Nice to be Wanted" Preview_
- A short preview for a play I co-wrote and starred in my senior year of highschool. I came up with the idea to shoot fake interviews for a workplace comedy style trailer, and wrote, shot, and edited this preview in under a week to promote our production.
