# **Short films**

## _Valentine_ 
- A short film depicting an unlikely connection between two polar opposites on Valentineâ€™s night. I made this film in my intro to film production course in early 2024. I wrote, casted, produced, directed, shot, and edited this short using university mandated equipment and Adobe Creative Suite. This project heavily utilized artful location and color theory, with all post production--sound mixing, color correction, and general editing--done in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## _Shot for Shot_
- A short film depicting a stressful student-film project between a group of enemies goes awry. This was my final film in my intro to film production class which I made with in group of four people. I worked in directing, producing, shooting, and editing this film among my peers. We were far more ambitious with this project than we were on our solo productions, opting for more challenging shots (long takes, steadycam) and produced lighting.
